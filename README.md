#Week 12: Final Project
I coded along with the videos, creating my own version of the application. I did just fine until I was trying to figure out how I would make a function to update the notes, and for some reason in the HTML that I'm passing into the page through the script in script.js, ${note} is [object Object]. However, note.text returns the text, note.title returns the title, and note.id returns the ID. It makes no sense to me. I looked into the issue and I just couldn't find an answer. The code you see here is not the greatest.
